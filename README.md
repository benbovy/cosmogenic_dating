cosmogenic_dating
=================

A few IPython notebooks to show examples of inference of exposure times and
erosion rates from measured cosmogenic nucleide concentration profiles.

It compares both bayesian and maximum likelihood approachs with different
optimization and/or sampling algorithms (grid search, non-linear fitting, MCMC...).
