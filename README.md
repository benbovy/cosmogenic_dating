cosmogenic_dating
=================

Some Python code and IPython notebooks to infer exposure times and erosion rates from measured cosmogenic nucleide concentration profiles.

It demonstrates both bayesian and maximum likelihood approachs with different minimization or sampling alogrithms (grid search, Markov Chain Monte Carlo...).

NOTE: Currently in development!!
